# Installation

Start by installing a current version of nodejs via your operating system's
package manager. Instructions for current packages for Debian and Ubuntu are
available in the
[nodesource github repository](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#deb). When the installation is complete, run the
following commands

```shell
run npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # install the required javascript packages
npm install expo-cli --save-dev  # install expo-cli as developer dependency
npm run start  # start the expo command-line interface
```

Once `expo` is started, follow the instructions on the screen.
